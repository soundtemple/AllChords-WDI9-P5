AllChords is a single page app built with ReactJS. It makes use of the HTML5 Web MIDI and Web Audio API's to synthesize sound and route midi to and from connected hardware midi controllers & synthesizers.

I built AllChords to simplify my composition process and to put the power of music theory at my fingertips.

Not being a great keyboard player, AllChords allows me to play chords with one finger and melodies without having to remember complicated fingering, while the display keeps me informed of the theory behind everything I am doing.
